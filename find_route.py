# find_route.py: Traverse the 'paths' table using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest
# distance between two points on or near the railway network.

# A 'path' is a non-branching section of track joining two nodes, identified as node1_id and node2_id.
# To minimise the number of permutations involved in database access, we stipulate that
# node1_id < node2_id.
# For each path, we know its actual geographical route (expressed in the database as a PostGIS linestring)
# and its length in metres.
